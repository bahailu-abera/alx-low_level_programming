 ## Linked Lists 
A Linked List is a linear data structure. Every linked list has two parts, the data section and the address section that holds the address of the next element in the list, which is called a node.

The size of the linked list is not fixed, and data items can be added at any locations in the list. The disadvantage is that to get to a node, we must traverse to all the way from the first node to the node that we require. The Linked List is like an array but unlike an array, it is not stored sequentially in the memory.

The most popular types of a linked list are:
	*.1. singly link list
	*.2. doubly link list.
This project is a single linked list problems with c progamming language.

below is the description for all files.

| 1-list_len.c     | a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.|
| 2-add_node.c     | a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.|
| 3-add_node_end.c | a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.      |
| 4-free_list.c    | a function that frees a list_t list.                              |
